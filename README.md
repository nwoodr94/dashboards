# dashboards

Dashboards allow the user to alter and visualize data in real time. 

### [Temperature Converter](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nwoodr94/dashboards/blob/master/temperature-dashboard.ipynb)
This dashboard generates a slider which allows the user to click and drag a Fahrenheit value, and will automatically update and visualize it alongside the equivalent Celsius.

I am using [Panel](https://panel.pyviz.org/index.html), which is a native dashboarding library in the Anaconda environment. I do not yet have deployment capabilities and so the samples here are static.
