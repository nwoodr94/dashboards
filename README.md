# dashboards

Dashboards allow the user to alter inputs and visualize data in real time. 

[Temperature Converter](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nwoodr94/dashboards/blob/master/temperature-dashboard.ipynb) generates a slider which allows the user to input a Fahrenheit value, and automatically visualize it alongside the equivalent Celsius.

I am still working on deployment capabilities and so the samples here are static.
